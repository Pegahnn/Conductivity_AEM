We propose a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates graph-based neural architectures (GCN and GAT) with a suite of descriptor-driven ensemble models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking Regressor), culminating in a Hybrid Graph–Attribute Regression Ensemble (HGARE). This multi-model approach simultaneously captures molecular topology through graph learning and physicochemical interpretability through descriptor analysis, enabling a comprehensive understanding of structure–conductivity relationships in anion exchange membranes.
